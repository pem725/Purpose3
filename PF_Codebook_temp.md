* Assessment number and date available in the dataset.

**Scoring Rules:** Tasks are rated in-person. Find the mean of each subscale and convert to percentages. For standard scoring for expert norms, compare the expert-normed scores obtained by the participant against the expert-normed scores of the normative sample.

**13\. Personalized Psychological Flexibility Index (PPFI)**  
**Baseline, 6-month Follow-Up, 2-year Follow-Up**

**Citation:** Kashdan, T. B., Disabato, D. J., Goodman, F. R.. Doorley, J. D., & McKnight, P. E. (in press). Understanding psychological flexibility: A multi-method exploration of pursuing valued goals despite the presence of distress. 

**Data Notes:** 

* Any variables in the dataset ending in “\_POMP” is a created percentage of that item.  
* Later versions of the PPFI are different.  
  * They do not include a second goal.  
  * They do not include the items 6, 13, and 17 into the subscales or main scale.  
  * It includes a Core Values measure.  
* Goals that are listed in Baseline appear again, unique to each individual, at the following time point(s).

**PPFI Part 1 Scoring Rules:** After entering a personal goal (b/fu1/fu2\_pf1\_goal), participants are asked about thoughts and feelings regarding the goal they expressed. They are then asked to do this again with a second personal goal (b/fu1/fu2\_pf2\_goal). Average scores for the subscales- *the avoidance subscale is not reverse scored*. To find the total PF score, find the mean *with all the Avoidance subscale questions reverse-scored* (because avoidance is not psychologically flexible)- do not include the orienting items (1-4).

**PPFI Part 1 Subscales:**

* Avoidance (av): 5-10  
* Acceptance (ac): 11-16  
* Harnessing (h): 17-22

**SPSS:** 

* Baseline  
  * First Goal  
    * Average of non-reverse-scored Avoidance items is scored as variable “b\_pf1\_av5\_mean\_nr”. There is a percentile score of this item as well, “b\_pf1\_av5\_mean\_nr\_POMP”, and a Z score, “Zb\_pf1\_av5\_mean\_nr”.  
    * Avoidance 5-item subscale (mean) is “b\_pf1\_av5\_mean”. There is a percentile score of this item as well, “b\_pf1\_av5\_mean\_POMP”.  
    * Acceptance 5-item subscale (mean) is “b\_pf1\_ac5\_mean”. There is a percentile score of this item as well, “b\_pf1\_ac5\_mean\_POMP,” and a Z score, “Zb\_pf1\_ac5\_mean”.  
    * Harnessing 5-item subscale (mean) is “b\_pf1\_h5\_mean”. There is a percentile score of this item as well, “b\_pf1\_h5\_mean\_POMP,” and a Z score, “Zb\_pf1\_h5\_mean”.  
    * Reverse-scored avoidance items using this variable naming convention: “b\_pf1\_av5\_r”.  
    * Mean of Avoidance (reverse-scored) and Acceptance: “b\_pf1\_avacc\_mean”. There is a percentile score of this item as well, “b\_pf1\_avacc\_mean\_POMP.”  
    * Total Psychological Flexibility mean is scored with reverse-scored avoidance items as variable “b\_pf1\_total\_mean”. There is a percentile score of this item as well, “b\_pf1\_total\_mean\_POMP”, and a Z score, “Zb\_pf1\_total\_mean”.  
  * Second Goal  
    * Reverse-scored avoidance items using this variable naming convention: “b\_pf2\_av5\_r”.  
    * Avoidance 5-item subscale (mean) is “b\_pf2\_av5\_mean”.  
    * Acceptance 5-item subscale (mean) is “b\_pf2\_ac5\_mean”.

**Citation:** Lyubomirsky, S., & Lepper, H. S. (1999). A measure of subjective happiness: Preliminary reliability and construct validation. *Social Indicators Research, 46*(2), 137–155. 

**Data Notes:** 

* Any variables in the dataset ending in “\_POMP” is a created percentage of that item.  
* Any variables in the dataset beginning with “Z” is a created z-score of that item.

**Scoring Rules:** Compute the reverse score of appropriate items (those ending in “\_NR”), then find the mean of the items. 

**SHS Subscales:**

* General Happiness: 1  
* Relative Happiness: 2  
* Characterization of Happiness: 3-4

**SPSS:** Total SHS at respective timepoints already scored as variables “b\_shs\_mean,” “fu1\_shs\_mean,” and “fu2\_shs\_mean”. Z scores created. General Happiness and Relative Happiness subscales are only one question so there was no need to be scored. Characterization of Happiness subscales does not yet exist in the dataset.

**Values:**   
	0 \= Not a Very Happy Person  
1-5  
6 \= A Very Happy Person

**Labels/Questions:**  
For the following statement, please circle the point on the scale that you feel is most appropriate in describing you.

**24\. Brief Mood Introspection Scale (BMIS)**  
**Baseline, 6-Month Follow-Up, 2-Year Follow-Up**

**Citation:** Mayer, J. D., & Gaschke, Y. N. (2001). Brief mood introspection scale (BMIS). *Psychology*, *19*(3), 1995-1995.

**Subscales:** 

* Pleasant-Unpleasant total score: 1, 2, 3R, 4R, 5, 6, 7R, 8R, 9R, 10R, 11, 12R, 13R, 14, 15R, 16  
* Arousal-Calm total score: 1, 3, 4R, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13R, 14, 15, 16  
* Positive-Tired Mood total score: 1, 4R, 5, 9R, 11, 14, 16  
* Negative-Relaxed Mood total score: 3, 7, 8, 12, 13R, 15

**Scoring Rules:** Compute the reverse score of appropriate items (those ending in “\_NR”), then find the mean of the items per subscale. Be careful with scoring as some items are reverse-scored for some and not for others. Each item also measures an emotion felt within the month. Z scores and percentile scores created for some time points.

**SPSS:** 

* Pleasant-Unpleasant total score: b/fu1/fu2\_bmis\_PU\_mean  
* Arousal-Calm total score:  b/fu1/fu2\_bmis\_AC\_mean  
* Positive-Tired Mood total score: b/fu1/fu2\_bmis\_PR\_mean  
* Negative-Relaxed Mood total score: b/fu1/fu2\_bmis\_NT\_mean

**Values:**   
0 \= Did not feel   
1 \= Felt a little  
2 \= Moderately felt  
3 \= Definitely felt

**25\. Balanced Measure of Psychological Needs Scale (BMPNS)**  
**Baseline, 6-Month Follow-Up, 2-Year Follow-Up**

**Citation:** Sheldon, K. M., & Hilpert, J. C. (2012). The balanced measure of psychological needs (BMPN) scale: An alternative domain general measure of need satisfaction. *Motivation and Emotion*, *36*(4), 439-451.

**Scoring Rules:** Compute the reverse score of appropriate items (those ending in “\_NR”), then find the mean of each need (relatedness, competence, and autonomy). Satisfaction and Dissatisfaction scores should be computed for each need (6 subscale scores in all). These may be examined separately, or, three aggregate need satisfaction scores can be computed by subtracting the dissatisfaction score for a particular need from the satisfaction score for that need. Percentile scores are labeled with “\_POMP” at the end of the variable name. Z scores are labeled with “Z” before the variable name.

**Subscales:**

* Relatedness: 1, 4R, 7, 10R, 13, 16R  
  * Relatedness Satisfaction: 1, 7, 13  
  * Related Dissatisfaction: 4, 10, 16 (not reverse-scored)  
  * Relatedness Difference: (satisfaction sum score \- dissatisfaction sum score)  
* Competence: 2, 5R, 8, 11R, 14,17R  
  * Competence Satisfaction: 2, 8, 14  
  * Competence Dissatisfaction: 5, 11, 17 (not reverse-scored)  
  * Competence Difference: (satisfaction sum score \- dissatisfaction sum score)  
* Autonomy: 3, 6R, 9, 12R, 15, 18R  
  * Autonomy Satisfaction: 3, 9, 15  
  * Autonomy Dissatisfaction: 6, 12, 18 (not reverse-scored)  
  * Autonomy Difference: (satisfaction sum score \- dissatisfaction sum score)

**SPSS:** 

* Relatedness  
  * Total: b/fu1/fu2\_bmpns\_R\_tot; b/fu1/fu2\_bmpns\_R\_tot\_POMP; Zb/Zfu1/fu2\_bmpns\_R\_tot

**Data Notes:**

* No variables were created for the PLE.  
* Items were coded differently based on how the participant responded to the item “Is this stressful event still ongoing?”  Ongoing events were coded as “fu2\_ple1\_1” whereas events that were no longer ongoing were coded as “ fu2\_ple1\_old\_1”.

**Values:**   
0 \= Very slightly not at all  
1 \= A little
